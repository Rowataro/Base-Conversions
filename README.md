This program has two functionalities. 
1. convertToBaseN can convert any number in base 10 to another base (base 2, base 16, etc). 
2. convertToBase10 does the opposite. A number in any other base is converted to base 10. 
3. convertBaseAToBaseB converts any base A number to a base B number. 

Examples: 
1. 255 (base 10) --> FF (base 16)
2. 1100100 (base 2) --> 100 (base 10)
3. 64 (base 16) --> 1100100 (base 2)
