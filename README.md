This program has two functionalities. 
1. convertToBaseN can convert any number in base 10 to another base (base 2, base 16, etc). 
2. convertToBase10 does the opposite. A number in any other base is converted to base 10. 

Examples: 
1. 255 (base 10) --> FF (base 16)
2. 1100100 (base 2) --> 100 (base 10)
